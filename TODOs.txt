TODOs:

Improve the ML pipeline as follows
Perform better feature engineering and extraction.
Implement/Choose a better ML model
Use appropriate statistical evaluation method to measure the performance of the model. Use the obtained results to continue improving your data science pipeline, using the baseline model as a reference.
Error analysis of the model using explainability tools
Analyze your final model performance and internal using feature importance tools (e.g., SHAP)
Derive interesting insights about the data and/or applications from your analysis.
Refer in your project to existing material (e.g., code, notebooks, academic papers) that directly relate to your dataset of choice.
Present the main, important parts of your full data science workflow and results in a user friendly human-readable Jupyter Notebook, that contains markup, visualizations and short block of code (long block should be deferred
